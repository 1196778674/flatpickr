## Introduction

`flatpickr` is a lightweight and powerful datetime picker. 

Lean, UX-driven, and extensible, yet it doesn't depend on any libraries. There's minimal UI but many themes. Rich, exposed APIs and event system make it suitable for any environment.

This "lean" philosophy translates to less size and better performance, with a bonus of not having to load 8 libraries for a calendar.

Dive right into it in the next section.
